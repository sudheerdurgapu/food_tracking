  - Manage menus: add, edit, or remove items.
  - View and manage orders: update status, view order details, and mark as completed.
  - Monitor user accounts and activity.
  - Generate reports on sales, popular items, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  git clone <repository-url>


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd food-delivery-app


3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install


4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Define the following variables:
     - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection URI.
     - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation.
