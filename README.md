# Food Delivery App

This project is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It includes a customer-facing front-end for ordering food and an admin panel for managing orders, menus, and other administrative tasks.

## Features

  - Browse through menus and place orders.
  - Create an account or log in to an existing one.
  - View order history and track the status of current orders.
  - Customize orders with special requests.

- **Admin Panel:**
  - Manage menus: add, edit, or remove items.
  - View and manage orders: update status, view order details, and mark as completed.
  - Monitor user accounts and activity.
  - Generate reports on sales, popular items, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  git clone <repository-url>


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd food-delivery-app


3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install


4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Define the following variables:
     - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection URI.
     - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation.
     - Other necessary environment variables (e.g., Stripe API keys).

5. Run the backend server:

npm run server


6. Run the frontend:

cd ../frontend
npm run dev


The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
